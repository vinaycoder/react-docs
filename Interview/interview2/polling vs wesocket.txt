Short Polling
  Short polling is an AJAX-based timer that calls at fixed delays.
    It sends an empty response
    It sends data object in its body (JSON Object)

  Lot of request that are processed as they come on server. Creates a lot of traffic (uses resources, but frees them as soon as response is send back):
example :  we can use this for delivery boy location


Long Polling
Long Polling works differently from short polling in the following way:

Client makes a request to the server
Server can respond in two ways:
  1 If it has some new data available, it can respond right away.
  2 If it doesn't have anything new data, it will keep that connection open for a period of time and when it receives new data it will respond back with updated data. if timeout happen again start connection and call to the server


WebSocket 
WebSocket is a computer communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. server can send data to client and client can send data to the server any time
