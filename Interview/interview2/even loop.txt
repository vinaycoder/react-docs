let a =true
setTimeout(()=>{
a=false
},2000)

while(a){
console.log('Hello);
}

Hello will continously printed. a will never set to false.javascript is a single thread language. after 2 second a will be set to false if current thread will be free but current thread is busy in loop so a will never set to false
